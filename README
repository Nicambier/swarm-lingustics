The main experiments are found in the folder
argos3-language
From there, compile the code with:

mkdir build
cd build/
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make

Then, from the main folder, you can try the experiments with (e.g.):
argos3 -c experiments/aggregation.argos




To test the code in lua/ (lua implementations), compile the code in the "cpp" subfolder with:
cd cpp/
mkdir build
cd build/
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make

Then set the environment variable ARGOS_PLUGIN_PATH to the full path in which the build/ directory is located: 
export ARGOS_PLUGIN_PATH=/path/to/swarm-lingustics/lua/cpp/build/

You can then try any experiment with:
argos3 -c experiment.argos (must be typed directly from the folder containing the experiment)




To test the naming game with kilobots, first type
export ARGOS_PLUGIN_PATH=/path/to/swarm-lingustics/argos3-kilobot-master/build/plugins/robots/kilobot
you can then try the naming game from the kilobot folder by typing:
cd argos3-kilobot-master
argos3 -c src/examples/experiments/kilobot_naming_game.argos
