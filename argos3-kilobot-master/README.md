# Differences between Kilombo and ARGoS

## Kilombo
  * Architecture
    * Single-thread, single process wrapper around kilolib.h
      * Robots must run the same behavior
      * Global variables cannot be used to contain state
  * Models
    * Only model offered is the Kilobot
    * Motion is kinematics with simple overlap resolution
      * Robots cannot push other objects
    * Communication neglects obstructions
    * Message drop has uniform probability

## ARGoS
  * Architecture
    * Multi-thread, multi-process architecture
    * Robots can run different behaviors
    * Global variables can be used to contain state
  * Models
    * Models of Kilobot, other robots, boxes, cylinders
      * Motion is full 2D dynamics
      * Robots can push other objects
    * Communication considers obstruction
    * Message drop considers local density
